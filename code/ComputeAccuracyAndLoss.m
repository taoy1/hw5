function [accuracy, loss] = ComputeAccuracyAndLoss(W, b, data, labels)
% [accuracy, loss] = ComputeAccuracyAndLoss(W, b, X, Y) computes the networks
% classification accuracy and cross entropy loss with respect to the data samples
% and ground truth labels provided in 'data' and labels'. The function should return
% the overall accuracy and the average cross-entropy loss.
